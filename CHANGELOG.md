# Release notes

<!-- do not remove -->

## 0.0.3

### New Features

- Create GitHub Action ([#6](https://api.github.com/repos/fastai/fastrelease/issues/6))
  - I did as much testing as I could locally, now I need to do the fun
    part of testing it live.    Once I'm confident it's working, then
    I can document it    @jph00 ready for review, after this I'll
    start tweaking it on my own



## 0.0.2

## 0.0.1
